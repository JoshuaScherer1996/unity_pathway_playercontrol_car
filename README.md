# Unity Pathway Junior Programmer Project - Player Control Car

This repository contains the first project from the Unity Pathway "Junior Programmer". The goal is to understand and implement the concept of Player Control.

## Branch local_multiplayer
In this branch the challenge was to include a simple but effective local multiplayer mode. I personally decided to get rid of the hood camera in this mode. While it isn't great to remove a feature from a new game mode that is a standard for the control scheme of the original mode, I believe that it doesn't make a lot of sense here given the very minimalistic scope of this feature showcase.
